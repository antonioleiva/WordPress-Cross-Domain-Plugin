#JT Access Control

Are you trying to get information from your WordPress site but you have two different domains and keep getting the Access-Control-Allow-Origin error? This plugin adds the correct headers to allow you to access your WordPress site using AJAX from any other domain. 

Simply install the plugin and add a list of domains under Settings > General then click save. WordPress will then start sending the correct headers to allow you to run cross-domain ajax with no problem.
