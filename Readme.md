#WordPress Cross-Domain AJAX GUI

Are you trying to get information from your WordPress site but you have two different domains and keep getting the Access-Control-Allow-Origin error? This plugin adds the correct headers to allow you to access your WordPress site using AJAX from any other domain. 

Simply install the plugin and add a list of domains under Settings > General then click save. WordPress will then start sending the correct headers to allow you to run cross-domain ajax with no problem.

## Features

* Adds a simple input in your general settings page to allow you to give cross-domain abilities to other sites.
## Usage

##Use

1. Copy the `wordpress-cross-domain` directory into your `wp-content/plugins` directory or install the zip file through WordPress's plugin installer
2. Navigate to the "Plugins" dashboard page
3. Locate the menu item that reads "WordPress Cross Domain"
4. Click on "Activate"
